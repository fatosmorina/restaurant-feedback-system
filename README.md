## Restaurant Feedback System Overview

### Restaurant Management API

#### Adding New Restaurants
This system includes an endpoint that allows users to add new restaurants. When using this feature, users need to provide basic details like the name and location of the restaurant.

#### Retrieving Restaurant Details
For a comprehensive view, there's an endpoint to retrieve detailed information about a restaurant. This includes an overall rating, which is calculated based on customer feedback.

### Customer Feedback API

#### Sharing Experiences
Customers can easily submit feedback through a dedicated endpoint. This involves providing a unique identifier for the restaurant, along with comments and a rating ranging from 1 to 5.

#### Diverse Perspectives
To offer transparency and a varied perspective, there's an endpoint that lists all feedback entries for a specific restaurant. This allows users to explore a range of customer experiences.

### Feedback Response API

#### Engaging Administrators
Administrators can actively respond to individual feedback entries using a designated endpoint. These responses are directly linked to specific feedback and seamlessly integrated with the feedback details.

In essence, the Restaurant Feedback System is a practical solution, utilizing the capabilities of .NET Core 6 to improve both customer engagement and restaurant management.
